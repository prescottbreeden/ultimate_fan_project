Things n stuff:

- a links need to work when you click on the box they're in, not just the text
    .. applies to nav and quiz selection

- divide by zero error hard to replicate

- footer is ugly as sin
    .. very least needs to live at the bottom of the page but not cover main content if viewport height is decreased

- typogrpahy structure is very wet and random
    .. overhaul where font styles, sizes and weights are being set for consistency
