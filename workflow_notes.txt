Things n stuff:

- a links need to work when you click on the box they're in, not just the text
    .. applies to nav, quiz selection, sign-in/out, user
    - update: quiz links fixed

- divide by zero error hard to replicate

- footer is ugly as sin
    .. very least needs to live at the bottom of the page but not cover main content if viewport height is decreased
    - update: removed most the text and slimmed it down, could still be improved but a good start

- typogrpahy structure is very wet and random
    .. overhaul where font styles, sizes and weights are being set for consistency
    - update: most completed, removed most instances of font size pointlessly repeating
